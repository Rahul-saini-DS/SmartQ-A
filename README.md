# SmartQ&A: Leveraging RAG, LangChain, Hugging Face, and Open-Source LLMs

## Project Overview

SmartQ&A is a Q&A application that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, Hugging Face, and open-source large language models (LLMs). The application extracts and processes data from URLs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. It achieves high accuracy and efficiency, enhancing user engagement.

## Features

- **Accurate Answers:** Utilizes RAG for retrieval-augmented generation to provide contextually relevant responses.
- **Advanced Integration:** Combines LangChain, Hugging Face transformers, and open-source LLMs for enhanced natural language understanding.
- **Efficient Processing:** Handles data from web sources with improved response accuracy and reduced latency.

## Environment Setup

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n env_langchain1 python=3.10
    ```

2. **Activate the Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate env_langchain1
    ```

3. **Upgrade Pip:**
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

4. **Install Required Packages:**
    - Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies.
    - Install the packages using:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
